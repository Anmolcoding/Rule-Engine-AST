# Rule Engine with Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)

## Overview

The Rule Engine application is designed to evaluate user eligibility based on various attributes like age, department, income, and spending. It uses an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to represent conditional rules and allows for dynamic creation, combination, and modification of these rules.

## Features

- **Rule Creation**: Dynamically create rules from string representations.
- **Rule Combination**: Combine multiple rules into a single AST.
- **Rule Evaluation**: Evaluate user data against the defined rules to determine eligibility.
- **Error Handling**: Handle invalid rule strings and data formats.
- **Rule Modification**: Modify existing rules and attributes.
- **User-Defined Functions**: (Future enhancement) Support advanced conditions with custom functions.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to set up and run the Rule Engine application.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required Python packages:
  - Flask (for API)
  - SQLAlchemy (for database interaction)
  - JSON (for data handling)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rule-engine.git
   cd rule-engine
   
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the Application:
python app.py
API Endpoints:

POST /create_rule: Create a rule from a rule string.

Request: { "rule_string": "((age > 30 AND department = 'Sales') OR (age < 25 AND department = 'Marketing')) AND (salary > 50000 OR experience > 5)" }
Response: Returns the AST representation of the rule.
POST /combine_rules: Combine multiple rules.

Request: { "rules": ["rule1_string", "rule2_string"] }
Response: Returns the combined AST.
POST /evaluate_rule: Evaluate a rule against user data.

Request: { "ast": ast_json, "data": { "age": 35, "department": "Sales", "salary": 60000, "experience": 3 } }
Response: Returns true or false.
Testing
To run the tests, you can use the following command:
pytest tests/
Make sure you have pytest installed:
pip install pytest

Creating a README.md file for your Rule Engine project is essential for guiding users through the setup, usage, and structure of the application. Below is a sample README.md file that you can customize based on your specific project requirements:
